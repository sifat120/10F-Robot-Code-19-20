Hey, thanks for taking a moment to read this!

This VEX part library consists of all the available parts as of May 23, 2016.
Some folders have a "Components" folder inside them. Do not modify the components folder, or
else some assembely files might not function correctly. When opening some assembly files, you
might be asked to locate the part files. The part files can be found inside the "Components"
folder.

Most of the parts will have both iMates and construction surfaces to make building easier
for you. *The constuction surfaces might be invisible for some parts*

Not all parts have been modeled by me. I've mostly just added iMates and
construction surfaces, as well as given the parts more appropriate names. If you prefer 
not to use iMates, feel free to disable them and make the construction surfaces visible.

If you have any problems or concerns, or you find any inconsistencies within the files, please let me know on
the VEX forum @Jacob Walter, or via email at jacob.cc.walter@gmail.com

Thanks again,

Jacob Walter (7842 Navigators)
